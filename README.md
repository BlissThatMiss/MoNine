MoNine: Mac OS 9 Xfce Icon Theme
some elements for the icon theme are from NineIcons, if youre looking for the modified Grassmunk themes I'm working on them as a separate project.
I've never posted anything to GitHub, so i hope this works!!
You should be able to just download the project's zip and put the folder inside your .icons folder to have it be selectable in the appearance menu.
