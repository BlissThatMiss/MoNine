MoNine: Mac OS 9 Xfce Theme and Icons 
some elements for the icon theme are from NineIcons and as for the theme is almost unchanged from Platinum 9 both by GrassMunk.
I've never posted anything to GitHub, so i hope this works!! The themes' archive has the different themes and the Platiplus Xfwm theme while the MoNine archive has the icon theme. If anything's wrong i'll be glad to do what i can!
